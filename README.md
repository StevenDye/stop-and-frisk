# Stop-and-Frisk in NYC
This project looks at the relationship between reported justifications for stops and outcomes (e.g. arrests) in New York City, comparing the Bloomberg era to the post-court-order policy. (On August 12, 2013, a judge found that the Bloomberg stop-and-frisk policy was illegal.)
