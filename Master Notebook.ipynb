    "Can we predict who will be arrested based on information obtained before the stop is initiated?\n",
    "\n",
    "We attempt to modeling what are effective stops, i.e.,  which ones lead to arrests and  non-arrests. With the issues that surround the issue, i.e., unreasonable search and seizure being unconstitutional, having a racial bias in profiling is illegal, and police activity without any effectiveness on crime is wasted resourse, we hope to make a model that can improve the conversion rate of stops."

This dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to the end of last year (2017). The sum of the data consists of 119 columns and 5,051,677 entires, resulting in over 1.9 GB of data."
